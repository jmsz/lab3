In HPGe detectors, signals are induced on the electrodes due to charge carrier motion in the crystal. A charge sensitive preamplifier integrates the current seen by an electrode and outputs a voltage proportional to the charge that was collected. The feedback resistor and capacitor provide an RC circuit which leads to an exponential decay of the preamplifier's output. Due to the long decay time of preamplifier output pulses, these signals are shaped before further processing to eliminate their long decay while preserving information about signal amplitude, timing and signal shape.

Although theoretically cusp or triangular filters give better noise performance, trapezoidal filtering is commonly used. This is due partially to the impracticality of digitizing a signal with a small peak. Additionally, detectors which see variable charge collection time. The flat top can be tuned to avoid ballistic deficit which would be present with other filters. \cite{Knoll}.

In this work, a digital trapezoidal filter was implemented and optimized for gamma-ray spectroscopy with a coaxial HPGe detector. A digital rather than analog implementation allows for greater ease and flexibility in tuning parameters. Conversely, analog shapers are easier to use have better timing properties. The two parameters in the filter that can be optimized are the peaking time, gap time. Due to the random nature of radioactive decay, even at low count rates pile-up must be considered. To prevent pile-up, shaped pulses should be kept short, minimizing peaking and gap times. However, making these parameters too short can lead to incomplete charge collection.

There are three main contributions to the electronic noise- series noise, parallel noise and 1/f noise. These contributions have different responses to changes in peaking time ($\tau$) and a balance between them must be found. The series noise $\propto \frac{1}{\tau}$. The parallel noise is $\propto\tau$. The 1/f noise is independent of $\tau$. Here $\tau$ is tuned to find the minimum in the total electronic noise.
