what is filtering
-diff parameters
-why important

A digital trapezoidal filter was implemented and optimized for gamma-ray spectroscopy with a coaxial HPGe detector. A digital rather than analog implementation allows for greater ease and flexibility in tuning parameters. The two parameters in the filter that can be optimized are the peaking time, gap time. Additionally, the exponential decay of the signals, which is used in the filter, was determined experimentally. In this study we optimized these parameters to achieve the best possible energy resolution.
