Timing information was extracted and 

which method was best

\subsection{Summary}


\subsection{Future Work}

There are many potential improvements and future steps that could be taken. The spread in signal trigger time will be investigated, as it may have an effect of the $\Delta t50$ values calculated. 

-better than just a linear fit
-lateral position
-finer grid
-collimation for verification

The difference in trigger time is determined by a on-board fast trapezoidal shaper. The trigger time may differ slightly between signals, leading to additional uncertainty. The effect of this jitter >>?? will need to be studied for more precise position determination.
